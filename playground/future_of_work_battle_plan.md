In 1933, John Maynard Keynes proposed that  "due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour", there will be widespread *technological unemployment* - a sort of ever-growing "natural unemployment".

- Massive rise of inequality
  - Those with education and higher pay less affected
  - Shift of wealth from labor to capital
- Implicit acquiescence - too few productive proposals
