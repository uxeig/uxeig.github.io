excerpt: "In 1930, Keynes predicted that technological progress would eliminate the need for human labor. Given today's economic system, what could be the possible consequences of widespread technological unemployment, given that economic and social systems remain unchanged? If people do not have to work for a living anymore, can the current way society is organized prevail? What would that mean for individuals, and could it be a good thing if Keynes were right?"

*This post is part of a three-part series on the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the labor market, the economy and its consequences for society. These posts are a way for me to organize my thoughts on the topic and maybe find and raise some issues or questions which are currently missing from the discourse.*

>"We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come - namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour."

What sounds like a quote from any current article on industrial automation was written by [John Maynard Keynes in 1930](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf), at the peak of the pre-Depression economic boom. It could as well have been written in 2000, when the Internet began taking off, or today, at the onset of what some call the ["Age of AI"](https://hbr.org/insight-center/the-age-of-ai). However, Keynes' prediction of widespread technological unemployment has not yet come true. Neither the introduction of industrial robots in the 1970s and 1980s nor Moore's law or the explosive growth of the internet and the [proliferation of personal computers in offices](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23509153) did not increase natural unemployment. To the contrary, with the exception of the 2008-2014 recession, natural unemployment has steadily decreased since 1978.

However, many have argued that [this time is different](https://psmag.com/economics/the-future-of-work-automations-effect-on-jobsthis-time-is-different), and in my [last blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-15-future-of-work %}) I argued that widespread technological unemployment is a possible, if not likely, consequence of the current technological developments. And even if there is no widespread technological unemployment, some jobs will be replaced by some type of technology. Three characteristics of this change are particularly interesting:

- **Not all sectors of the economy will be affected in equal proportions.** To the contrary: In sales, manufacturing and logistics, disproportionately many jobs are at risk of being displaced by automation, while in health care, teaching and engineering, few jobs are at a high risk.
- **Somewhat counterintuitively, most of those affected will not be manual laborers**, but service employees performing routine and increasingly also nonroutine cognitive tasks.
- **Those with higher incomes and college education will be replaced last**. [Frey & Osborne](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) have shown that income and having a Bachelor's degree or higher is negatively correlated with risk of being replaced by technology.

For these reasons, while it is not clear that advances in artificial intelligence and robotics cause widespread technological unemployment, it is likely for it to split society along sectoral, income, educational and occupational lines. When imagining what might happen to society and individuals as these trends unfold, one must not just keep in mind that there might be fewer jobs, but also that these jobs will be unequally distributed, which might just be a worse problem than what Keynes had imagined.

# Rising Inequality

So what could be the consequences if the labor market developed as outlined in the [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-15-future-of-work %}), given that everything else (such as economic and social policy or the health care and legal systems) remains as it is today?

If the amount of jobs available in the economy regardless of differences in sectors, demographics or occupations decreases while the population remains stagnant, there natural rate of unemployment will be higher, so a larger share of the population will be out of work at any given point in time, and that more or less permanently - because when jobs are scarce, [the longer you are unemployed, the more likely you are to remain unemployed](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/the-terrifying-reality-of-long-term-unemployment/274957/). Because one can assume that not all jobs will vanish simultaneously, one can assume that at least for several decades, some people will earn money from working while others don't, and that because fewer people are working and more and more work is done by intelligent machines, wealth will be increasingly generated by capital (such as robots), not labor. Here, Nobel prize-winning economist [Paul Krugman sees](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robots/) the root of most evils to befall society in the next few decades: Automation means that those owning the means of production (the directors, CEOs, board members and shareholders of corporations) are generating more and more wealth for themselves, while the wealth of those who earned their daily bread by the sweat of their brows (such as assembly line workers, salespeople, office staff or any employee, really) will, lacking means to increase it, dwindle over time. Now, it could be that this is of no consequence if those who lost their jobs not only relied on labor, but also on capital to generate wealth and obtain an income. In fact, the opposite is true: Just over half of all Americans own shares or invested in the stock market in one way or another, and the number is falling, down from 65% just before the 2008 financial crisis. This also means that just under half of Americans have no ownership whatsoever in the means of production.[^1] The decreasing importance of labor for GDP is not a recent phenomenon: Between 1970 and 2010, labor's share in GDP has fallen, a trend which will be exacerbated in the years to come. And if share ownership continues falling - which it could, as investment in capital requires disposable income to invest, something hard to come by for most American employees - this means that capital is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people, funneling an increasing share of the generated wealth into the hands of this relatively small elite while leaving a majority of people without a means of earning an income, causing tremendous income inequality. This argument comes straight out of the Marxist handbook, and it is interesting to see Paul Krugman, a liberal economist, highlighting the same and, according to him, recently largely overlooked dynamics between labor and capital.

So income inequality may rise. So what? Maybe, [according to Rawls](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/02/what-moral-philosophy-tells-us-about-income-inequality/252455/), inequality is not a bad thing if it is "to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society" - in other words, if the poor are better off **in absolute terms**. It turns out, however, that the opposite is true, and that rising economic inequality has a number of adverse consequences for political stability and individual welfare.

### Anacyclosis and the French Revolution

[Some political economists argue](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ca73/fd703e740641972971510c39fb6f72eca7d6.pdf) that a democratic form of government can exist despite high levels of wealth inequality, and that wealth inequality can persist despite a democratic government. [Others, however, argue](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/may/02/higher-inequality-move-away-from-democracy-branko-milanovic-big-data#img-1) that with high levels of inequality, democracy is likely to devolve into plutocracy, government by a rich elite. This could be seen as a modern incarnation of [anacyclosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacyclosis), the idea that democratic government will inevitably devolve into first an oligarchy and then a tyranny because of an inherent human greed for money and power. Indeed, espousing a purely economic view, it would not be rational for the rich, capital-owning elite to share its wealth by redistribution, but instead to capture government to avoid such redistribution and keep its wealth, turning to repressive methods to keep society from collapsing into anarchy. And because anacyclosis is, by definition, cyclic, it must return to democracy again - usually by way of revolution.

Here, the French Revolution can be used to illustrate the point.[^2] Pre-1789 French society was highly unequal, both politically and economically. It was a feudal society in which a small group of people (the nobility and clergy as well as a few wealthy merchants) owned a disproportionate share of the wealth. Inequality was exacerbated by high taxes for peasants and artisans, levied to support costly foreign wars as well as an increasingly large and exuberant royal court at Versailles. The political system of absolute monarchy supported this inequality by denying the vast majority of people a say in politics. This absolute monarchy at the pinnacle of inequality was overthrown in 1789, when the merchant (or, in modern terms, "middle") class attempted to establish a republic and to egalize, in part, political rights and wealth. This republic, however, was short-lived, as elites from within seized power and established an oligarchy, which in turn was supplanted by Napoleon Bonaparte's empire in 1804, marking the return of a system in which political power was concentrated in the hands of one single person. This cycle was repeated a few more times in the subsequent history of France, as well as in other European countries around the same time.

It is important to keep in mind that this is merely an analogy - but it serves to show that, if the context "fits", democracies can degenerate into oligarchies (or aristocracies or plutocracies), which in turn can devolve into absolutism (or tyranny or a dictatorship), which can end in a violent revolution. In the case in which a majority of the population has no means to earn a living while a minority owns nearly all the wealth, one could argue that the context "fits" for such a wheel to be set in motion, putting an end to today's democratic mode of political and social organization. Maybe the recent electoral successes of right-wing or populist parties in Italy, France, Germany, Finland or Austria and the 2016 U.S. election with the shutting out of a progressive candidate from the Democratic nomination and the successful candidacy of a populist with little respect for democratic institutions marks a trend away from democracy "as we know it" and may (economists may disagree with me here) be fuelled at least in part by growing income inequality. If our imaginary scenario here plays out and economic and social policy does not change, [populism supported by inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/5557f806-5a75-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b) might become a permanent fixture of a society without work.

# A humanitarian catastrophe?

There is another, more troubling consequence of massive technological unemployment. As the impact of automation on jobs is extremely unevenly distributed across occupations, there will be some sectors in which hardly any jobs will remain, while in other sectors, few jobs will be lost. This also means, however, that if a worker in a sector in which automation has a high impact loses her job, she will not only be hard-pressed to find the same job at a different employer (as that one would likely also have disappeared), but struggle to find any job in the same sector, as for that sector, worker supply will quickly outpace worker demand. And because cross-sector mobility (the ability and opportunity to learn the skills required for working in a different sector) [tends to be costly](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2695991.pdf), she will likely remain unemployed. Today, [half of those unemployed or working less than full-time in the United States](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-poverty-rates-among-working-adults) are below the poverty line. In other countries with better social security systems, those unemployed are somewhat better off, but even in Germany, with its comparatively efficient social security system, [poverty is far from eradicated](http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2017-03/armutsbericht-2017-deutschland-paritaetischer-wohlfahrtsverband-faq). A rise in poverty in absolute terms means fewer people with access to education, health care or even [food](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/hunger/), particularly in today's United States.

Equally troubling is that unemployment tends to be highly unequally distributed between regions. One case in point may be Detroit, which after the decline of automotive manufacturing in the area had unemployment rates far higher than the national average. [Youngstown, Ohio](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/) serves as a more concrete example. In 1977, the local steel mills closed as manufacturing moved abroad and 50,000 jobs were lost over the course of only five years. The consequence was *regional depression* - Mahoning County experienced a small-scale version of the scenario which, [as some fear](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100), might befall the global economy. Without a social security system to compensate the loss in income due to lack of work, a large share of the population of Youngstown became poor. Youngstown became a pocket of *concentrated poverty*. As the replacement of workers by technology will greatly differ between sectors and as many regions rely only on a few sectors for jobs, many more areas of concentrated poverty will emerge in the future. And as sociological research on urban concentrated poverty shows, [concentrated poverty tends to perpetuate itself](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/08/americas-biggest-problem-is-concentrated-poverty-not-inequality/400892/) due to persistent and self-reinforcing lack of opportunities as well as proliferating social issues such as crime, drug abuse and structural discrimination. If no action is taken to prevent and combat concentrated poverty in a post-human-labor world, a large amount of people will be stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty.

# A psychological catastrophe?

In ["Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren"](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf), Keynes sees yet another problem in man not having to work for his living, or the solution to the "economic problem":

> "If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose. Will this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades."

Keynes sees a potential problem in man, who has been accustomed to work for a living, readjusting in a world in which he does not have to:

>" [...] there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. So, if the stability of our society and our psyche depends so heavily on work, would they not collapse if people worked less, or not at all?"

According to Keynes, widespread technological unemployment could have a large impact on our collective and individual psyches. In today's capitalist societies, a large share of what we think about ourselves, how we feel about ourselves and how happy we are are determined by our job. It seems that working - irrespective of the particular job - gives people a sense of self-worth. Conversely, being unemployed significantly harms our sense of self-worth: Among the unemployed, depression and other mental disorders occur [over three times](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2015/14_0451.htm) [more frequently](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/the-mental-health-consequences-of-unemployment/372449/) than among the rest of the population. Additionally, [some argue](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), based on evidence from Youngstown, that concentrated poverty causes individuals to lose faith in their collective institutions. And, if Keynes' economic problem were solved, would we not simply climb up the [hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) and find different things, such as our [social lives](https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2017.1b16), to make us unhappy? Could Keynes, again, be right?

It turns out that the answer is more complicated. Work itself, or at least in its current form, can be conducive to mental illness. Work often involves mental stressors such as long work hours, heavy workloads or organizational constraints which can cause both physical and psychological symptoms of illnesses such as burn-out syndrome, anxiety or depression. Indeed, there is a long [scholarly tradition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41282-017-0057-9) of linking free-market capitalism (in which a majority of people, at least currently, have to work for a living) with [mental illness](http://www.redpepper.org.uk/a-mad-world-capitalism-and-the-rise-of-mental-illness/). According to a recent [poll](http://news.gallup.com/opinion/chairman/212045/world-broken-workplace.aspx?g_source=position1&g_medium=related&g_campaign=tiles), 85% of all people in the world (how can one reliably determine that number in a poll?) are "disengaged" at work or do not like their jobs. If working were not an economic necessity, would we not be happier? Yuval Harari would agree that if we worked less and maybe differently, we could be. In his book [*Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind), he argues that in hunter-gatherer societies, people worked (hunted and gathered) no more than three to four hours a day. After the Agricultural Revolution, as the sowing, tending and reaping of more and more produce became mankind's chief occupation, work hours increased to around eight hours a day, and increased yet again during the Industrial Revolution, at least for some people, to up to twelve hours a day. But because man spent around 180,000 years from the emergence of homo sapiens to the Agricultural Revolution working relatively little, Harari argues that our brains evolved to a hunter-gatherer schedule and not that of a modern-day farmer, consultant or office clerk. He argues that many of our anxieties and depressions are at least partly due to a lifestyle which developed too quickly for evolution to follow suit. So in a way, the development of technologies capable of doing most of the work for us could allow us to develop a form of lifestyle which is more suited to the way our brains work and in which we could be happier.

The argument, then, can go both ways - widespread technological unemployment can make us crazy, or it can free us from the oppressive pressures of the workplace. Turning again to Youngstown, one finds that many people there found a way to keep themselves sufficiently busy. Some, out of necessity, put [Lawrence Katz' ideas](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/lawrence-katz-artisanal-economy-work-what-you-make-it/) into practice and became artisans, doing what they could do best and trying to make a living from it, working less hours and combining low-pressure capitalism with a sort of ["gig economy"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/20/review-gig-economy-gradual-change-quick-fixes-workers-unions). This may not be for everyone, so alternatives are needed. Alternative forms of economic and social organization, such as [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune) similar to [Kibbutzim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz) may provide food for thought, as does the anthropological perspective offered earlier. The true problem would be applying such approaches without decreasing living standards - and actually finding a viable approach, which I have not. For this reason it is of paramount importance not only to find an alternative mode of economic and social organization, but also to find policies which facilitate the transition to an economy in which humans do not have to work for a living. From the above paragraphs, one may infer that in the context of today's neoliberal laissez-faire capitalism, rising natural unemployment will cause considerable short- and at least medium-term material and psychological damage. In the next post, I would like to discuss some concrete policy alternatives which could potentially mitigate such a transition and help realize the constructive potential of increasingly clever machines without hurting people in the process.

[^1]: This ignores the possibility of people owning means of production without investing in the stock market. Indeed, individuals who own shares of privately traded companies or simply have their own business own capital (as in means of production) without investing in the stock market. However, I assume that the number of such people is small compared to the number of employees having no share whatsoever in the means of production.

[^2]: I actually don't like using historical analogies, because they are necessarily taken out of context and applied to a different context. One cannot productively compare the economy and society of 18th century France with today's global economies and societies. But this whole post is speculative and the point of the analogy is to illustrate that there are historical examples for anacyclosis, which is not the same as saying anacyclosis *must* happen or *will* happen or that the events of 1789 and after were not highly contingent on the socioeconomic and cultural context of the time.
