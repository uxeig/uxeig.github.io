excerpt: "When a large proportion of tasks in an economy are automatized, wealth inequality and poverty levels are likely to rise. So how can policymakers assure that progress in the fields of artificial intelligence and automation technology increases people's quality of life rather than diminishing it?"

*This post is part of a three-part series on the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the labor market, the economy and its consequences for society. These posts are a way for me to organize my thoughts on the topic and maybe find and raise some issues or questions which are currently missing from the discourse.*

<br/>

In my [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-02-consequences_massive_unemployment %}), I argued that in an economy in which a large proportion of tasks is performed by machines or in software rather than by human workers, there will be higher levels of wealth inequality, natural unemployment as well as sectorally and regionally concentrated poverty. Instead of benefitting from technological innovations,[^1] large parts of the population would suffer from decreasing living standards. So to realize the potential of intelligent machines - improving human lives by eliminating the need for strenuous physical or dull cognitive labor - society must either find alternatives or modifications to its current mode of economic organization, or find social and economic policies to avoid the above mentioned hazards. As it is often the case with relatively new developments, newspapers, magazines and television have mostly focused on painting an [apocalyptic picture of the automated economy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/20/robots-are-not-destroying-jobs-but-they-are-hollow-out-the-middle-class) and much more rarely tried to explore some concrete social policies or constructive criticims of the economic system to help the transition to an economy in which humans do not *have* to work for a living, but can if they want to (and are not poor if they choose not to).

# Redistribution or Regulation?

Free-market capitalists often say that in an ideal capitalist economy, wealth and prices are distributed by the "invisible hand" of the market. In reality, however, this is almost never the case. Most prices, wages and investment decisions are influenced to some degree by the "visible hand" of government, which acts upon the market via redistribution and regulation[^2] to ensure socially desirable market outcomes. From this perspective, robots and computers replacing humans can be seen as an at least partially undesirable market outcome,[^3] provided it really results in increasing inequality and poverty. A government interested in avoiding these consequences could turn to regulation to force the market to respect certain norms and values, such as a living wage for every working-age person, or to achieve certain macroeconomic goals, such as full employment. A historical example for regulation working well to force the market to avoid socially undesirable outcomes is the [U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act) and the [establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/history), the main environmental regulator in the United States, in the same year. From 1970 to 2015, the average concentration of the six most common air pollutants [dropped over 70%](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/progress-cleaning-air-and-improving-peoples-health#pollution). The Clean Air Act is commonly credited as the main cause of the drop, as it not only forced excessively polluting plants to shut down or install "scrubbers" to filter out pollutants, but also spurred innovation in cleaner manufacturing and renewable energy. On a regional level, California's 1988 Clean Air Act showed [similar results](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031999600081X). Why not, then, apply the same reasoning to robots and artificial intelligence?

First, it is not obvious how to prevent the socially undesirable aspects of an automatized economy with regulation because it is not yet clear what these aspects are. Should the new laws and acts aim at reducing unemployment, inequality, or a combination of the two? Then, it is not immediately clear how regulation can effectively mitigate these effects. In the case of the Clean Air Act, the solution was relatively straightforward: Force companies to pollute less by imposing limits on emissions. Should governments now impose limits on the number of industrial robots per factory, a minimally required ratio of human employees versus robots or a minimally required number of human employees per million dollars of revenue? Or should governments restrict the "power" of artificially intelligent systems, and if so, how would they measure that power?

Second, whenever governments draft and pass regulations concerning new technologies, the cumbersome lawmaking process tends to create a lag behind technological development - technologies tend to evolve too fast for politicians to regulate them. This [regulatory disconnect](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17579961.2017.1304921) is evident in the recent attempts by multiple countries to curb hate speech on social networks - in 2017, the German Bundestag [passed a law](https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2017/kw26-de-netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz/513398) requiring the operators of online platforms to delete "apparently illicit content", 12 years after the creation of Reddit, 13 years after the creation of Facebook and 14 years after the creation of 4chan. Another case in point is financial regulation - oftentimes, when regulatory agencies pass new regulations on the banking sector, banks invent new financial instruments to subvert them. In the case of autonomous robots or artificially intelligent systems, it is highly likely that such systems impact the economy and labor markets before lawmakers can impose effective and purposeful regulations on them.

A last downside to regulation is that it might simply not be desirable to impose regulations, because [premature and obtrusive legislation might hamper scientific advancement](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17579961.2017.1304921). If such regulations were passed to, say, protect the local labor market from competition by robots, not only would it be less profitable for local research institutes, universities and companies to develop new artificially intelligent machines, but large parts of the local artificial intelligence industry would migrate elsewhere - preferably to places with less stringent regulations - taking jobs and taxable revenue with them. Compounding the problem, it would probably also do its business elsewhere, increasing other countries' productivities while the local productivity remains limited to that of its less efficient human workers. So while some regulation will be required (mostly to keep [factories safe](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51df34b1e4b08840dcfd2841/t/582442f620099e166efe959e/1478771456961/ROS-I-Conf2016-day2-06-jacobs.pdf) and [monopolies from forming](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/should-america-s-tech-giants-be-broken-up)), excessive regulation - particularly regulation curbing the *use* of industrial robots and artificial intelligence for manufacturing or the provision of services - must be avoided. Instead, governments could turn to redistribution as a means of alleviating the growing pains of an automated economy.

# A Tax on Robots?

Almost all forms of government modern and ancient have redistributed wealth between different parts of society in one way or another. While redistribution was often a means for the ruling elites to enrich themselves, modern governments generally redistribute for the purpose of fostering some degree of social equality. It is therefore relatively straightforward to imagine that redistribution can alleviate some of the problems societies may have to face when transitioning to an economy in which high rates of natural unemployment and wealth inequality are the norm - the state must simply collect money from those benefitting from the new economy (the owners of the means of production - robots and software), and distribute it to those disadvantaged by it (former manual or cognitive laborers). There are many possible tax/redistribution schemes, out of which I would like to discuss three: Higher capital gains and estate taxes, redeployment taxes and the increasingly popular but ill-defined "robot tax".

As outlined in the [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-02-consequences_massive_unemployment %}), [Paul Krugman](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robots/) and [other ](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/wealth-inequality-isnt-inevitable-its-a-political-choice/) [economists](http://www.robertdkirkby.com/blog/2015/summary-of-piketty-i/) have identified that due to digitalization and automation, capital's share of income is rising while labor's share is falling, spelling trouble for those currently relying on labor for making a living. Currently, however, in the United States, [labor bears the largest share of the tax burden](https://taxfoundation.org/labor-bears-corporate-tax/) (the same applies for other countries) - and the recently passed tax bill, reducing corporate taxes while keeping payroll taxes unchanged, is projected to [exacerbate wealth inequality](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/opinion/taxes-inequality-charts.html). To offset the increase in inequality by automation, however, the taxation scheme should aim to do the opposite: Decrease payroll taxes for the remaining workers and increase capital gains taxes, as they are paid by the increasingly wealthy owners of the robots and data centers. Likewise, most economists agree that once an individual owns capital and receives income from it, her descendants will inherit a share of the capital and use its proceeds to buy more capital while those who do not inherit capital have much smaller chances of being able to afford to buy capital - in short, inheritance perpetuates wealth inequality by accumulating capital in the hands of a small, wealthy minority. By increasing estate taxes, government can ensure that at least a part of the accumulated capital and capital gains is redistributed to those lacking it, increasing their chances of acquiring capital of their own.

Another, much less talked about redistribution scheme is a [redeployment tax](https://www.eu-robotics.net/sparc/10-success-stories/the-robot-economy-part-1-interview.html?changelang=2) - a tax paid by companies for laying off workers and replacing them by automation technology or software. The idea is that companies have a moral obligation to their workers and that when workers are fired, the previous employer (or, in this case, the state) must ensure that they continue to receive an income - be it higher unemployment benefits, labor income after retraining, or, preferably, through shares in capital, all of which could be financed with a redeployment tax.[^4]

The often-discussed "robot tax", or tax on automation technology (and, depending on the definition, artificial intelligence), takes this idea a step further. There are a few ways of implementing such a tax, the most commonly cited of which is a raise of corporate taxes depending on the degree of automation in the industry. It has been endorsed by [Bill Gates](https://qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes/) as well as economists such as [Robert Shiller](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/temporary-robot-tax-finances-adjustment-by-robert-j--shiller-2017-03?barrier=accessreg), who provides a number of arguments in its favor: For once, one could [consider increased wealth inequality an externality](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/22/robots-tax-bill-gates-income-inequality)[^5] and a "robot tax" a way to "price in" that externality, so that those causing the wealth inequality also pay for alleviating it. Furthermore, he [argues](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/22/robots-tax-bill-gates-income-inequality) that it may be more politically acceptable to "tax the robots" (or the companies owning them) rather than the individuals profiting from them. The truly interesting aspects of a robot tax, however, are the arguments put forward by its detractors. [David Friedman argues](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.de/2017/03/a-proposal-to-triple-tax-robots.html) that "robot taxes" effectively mean a "triple tax" on capital gains, as the corporation already pays corporate taxes, then its shareholders pay capital gains taxes on received dividends - a robot tax would merely be a third tax on the same income. He also argues that there is no reason for taxing robots in particular, as "capital has been substituting for labor at least since the invention of the plow". While the former is true (higher taxes for *all* capital gains would decrease inequality) the latter is a cynical statement which, in this context, ought to be refuted in a separate post. Many other economists, politicians and businesspeople also make a case similar to that against regulation: That a "robot tax" would amount to a ["tax on progress"](https://qz.com/997596/eu-commissioner-andrus-ansip-does-not-support-bill-gates-idea-for-a-robot-tax/) and that it appeals to a populist, neo-Luddite resentment against autonomous technology. The [increasingly bad reputation](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/robot-tax-job-elimination-livable-wage) of robots and artificial intelligence, combined with the unwillingness and lack of incentives of national governments, defense contractors and robotics companies to go beyond *talking* about the ethical and moral purpose of technology - what *should* technology do for us, and how can we get it to do that? - creates an environment hostile to productive debate. Much of the discourse on robot taxes reflects this phenomenon. Interestingly enough, a more radical idea, a universal basic income, has spurned some serious and highly productive discussions about what direction society could move towards.

# Universal Basic Income

When I first heard about the idea of a universal basic income being seriously discussed by mainstream politicians such as [Barack Obama](http://www.businessinsider.de/where-us-politicians-stand-on-universal-basic-income-2017-9?r=US&IR=T#/#barack-obama-2), I was extremely surprised. The concept has existed since [at least the 16th century](http://fortune.com/2017/06/29/universal-basic-income-history/) but has largely been confined to communist and utopian socialist theory. There have been interesting attempts of implementing a universal basic income on smaller scales, however: One example is the [Alaska Permanent Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund), a fund from oil mining revenues which pays each Alaskan resident a more or less unconditional annual dividend. [Some economists](https://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2006/leadership/grundeinkommen-als-alternative-zu-hartz-iv-ausgerechnet-grundeinkommen/) have long argued for a universal basic income in various forms (such as a ["negative income tax"](http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/): The lower your regular income, the more money you receive from the state); however, until a few years ago, mainstream politicians have shirked real discussions about it, out of [fear from being labelled a "Socialist" in the US](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/obama-cuba-trip-socialism-213757) and following the trend of increasing market liberalization and deregulation from the 1990s until the financial crisis. Over the course of the past few years, however, the idea of a universal basic income has gained considerable attention in the mainstream media and has been considered or proposed by politicians across the political spectrum. Its merits, however, are not immediately obvious.

A universal basic income, defined as a monthly payment to all citizens regardless of age, employment status or other characteristics, aims to provide all members of society with the minimally required means for subsistence, the definition of which is up to political debate. Were this defined as the poverty threshold, it would immediately eliminate poverty and thereby reduce inequality, at least in the short term. A universal basic income would essentially replace the be existing social security system, most notably social insurance. [Thomas Straubhaar](https://archive.intereconomics.eu/year/2017/2/on-the-economics-of-a-universal-basic-income/) argues that this is a good thing: It eliminates the economic inefficiency of workers not being able to choose their own insurance (but the insurance policies being prescribed for them by society), "frees the labour market from social-political redistribution tasks" and eliminates bureaucratic "leakage" of resources by virtue of its simplicity. Detractors of a universal basic income often argue that it would disincentivize people from working. Straubhaar suggests that the opposite is the case: Because the universal basic income (UBI) would be financed primarily from income taxes on capital and labor, and because a socially equitable outcome (a high UBI) is only possible if there is sufficient taxable income, employers and society in general would be incentivized to *create* (high-paying) jobs as long as sufficient taxable income can not be generated from capital alone - which will be the case for at least several decades. A similar point is made by the engineers of [Finland's experiment with a universal basic income](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true): A UBI could remove the disincentives, such as applying and reapplying for unemployment benefits, which prevent the unemployed from taking up short-time work. Moreover, aside from possible economic benefits, Straubhaar highlights social benefits as well - that with a progressive taxation system, it would provide *just* redistribution while at the same time freeing people from a "paternalistic social policy of indirect aid".

Critics of a UBI call it a ["distraction from these core issues of economic power"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/universal-income-no-panacea-labour) as it removes the focus of economic reform from current labor market problems such as the low wages and long work hours in many professions which cannot be automated away quickly (such as care for the sick and elderly), or that it would be [morally treacherous](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/28/tory-mp-condemns-universal-basic-income-on-moral-grounds) because not forcing people to work makes people unhappy because man was "hardwired" to work (a paternalistic and ignorant argument I strongly questioned in a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-02-consequences_massive_unemployment %}))). Whatever their merits, however, this is a discussion in which the voices of critics and proponents alike are extremely important. It is the first serious discussion about the fundamentals of modern social and economic policy after the fall of the Soviet Union; more notably, it is the first modern discussion about and opportunity to rethink the fundamentals of economic and social policy based on *humanist principles* - that the economy should exist for the benefit of the people and not the other way around. Economic activity should be organized according to the values espoused by society and serve the needs of its members. The debate about what humans need, whether we define ourselves through work, whether we need to be incentivized by a system to work in order to be happy and whether we all, independent of our merits, deserve to have the means required for subsistence just by virtue of being human is a debate we as a society should have started long ago. It gives me hope for the return of aspirational ethics to politics, and of the redefinition of politics as the process of serving the humans it is comprised of, and of organizing it (and its economy) to serve its members. If this is the case, I'm all for automation: Society will shape it, and the economy it drives, according to its needs.

[^1]: It is an interesting question whether one can say that "mankind" has ever really benefitted from technological progress. Denying it would be nothing but cynical: Advances in the field of medicine have [doubled life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) compared to the 18th century in most parts of the world. However, this is no consolation to the millions who died from technological advances in artillery on the battlefields of the First World War, the families of the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs, the children working in the coal mines of 19th-century France or the victims of climate change-induced natural catastrophes. For most people in the Northern part of the Western hemisphere, technological progress probably improved their quality of life more or less steadily over the past 200 years. For many others, not so much, which goes to show that technology is worthless unless it is used for a "proper" purpose or in a socially desirable way, and does not have catastrophic side effects.

[^2]: There are also other ways, which are omitted here, by which a government can intervene in the market, such as through subsidies. Another example is the government influencing prices by directly participating in the market as a buyer and seller (such as for government bonds to influence interest rates), or by enacting fiscal policies (like printing money).

[^3]: The definition of "undesirable" is up those in government. If government is run by wealthy factory owners or investors and if they act primarily in their own self-interest, then any negative social consequences might not be deemed undesirable as long as those in government make a profit.

[^4]: A redeployment tax was [considered by the European Parliament](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-robots-lawmaking/european-parliament-calls-for-robot-law-rejects-robot-tax-idUSKBN15V2KM) but did not pass.

[^5]: A cost not paid for by the consumer of a good or a cost not reflected in the price of a good. Usually these are social costs such as health care expenditures (which are not included in the price of cigarettes) or climate change (which is not (yet) considered in the price of fossil fuels).
